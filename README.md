OpenMaya
========

This is a repository for all mayaTo renderer connections I create. 
There are connections for mantra (mayaToMantra) Appleseed (mayaToAppleseed) and others.

The idea is to develop a renderer framework to be able to implement a new renderer without reimplementing the 
same procedures again and again. 

A description of all renderers is/will be available on http://www.openmaya.net.

At the moment it's all VisualStudio project. Just starting to lear cmake, simply to be able to compile some OpenSource projects.

Because these are my first steps releasing code, I'll have to learn a lot how to do it the right way. So please let me know how
I can improve this project, or do it yourself.
